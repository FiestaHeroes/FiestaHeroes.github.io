<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Mr. Sionic, we would like to
start by learning about your background. Do you come from a technical degree
such as computer engineering, or do you come from a school focused in
humanities, such as art or business?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I have been working with PCs
since I was 5 years old. 1980's', the popular PC in Japan was made by NEC, and
what I learned using them has been the foundation of my life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I am a graduate of Aoyama Gakuin
University, Department of Education, Faculty of Letters. Now this university is
famous for the sport &quot;Ekiden&quot; marathon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I entered the university with the
intention of becoming a teacher of Japanese literature. However, after dealing
with UNIX in the university's computer system and especially learning how the
World Wide Web works, I had the idea of using the Internet as an effective tool
for education in Japan, which became the theme of my research.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The term &quot;e-Larning&quot; is
used today, but before that (on a slow 14,400 bps communication line!), the
Internet had already been used for distance education. They were experimenting
with the use of video and audio for distance education.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>When you graduated from
college, were you aiming to join the gaming industry?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>At the time of graduation from
university, Japanese young people were collectively referred to as the
&quot;Ice Age Generation,&quot; and it was difficult for them to find a job at
a general company. It is a custom unique to Japan to graduate from university
in four years, with the exception of those who continue their studies at
university, who uniformly aim to find a job at a company.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>However, this custom collapsed
during the ice age generation, and for several years, society as a whole hired
fewer young people into companies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I wanted to work in the game
industry (I was especially interested in Sega and Namco), but in this
situation, I thought it would be very inefficient and lose young hours of my
life to go around bowing down to companies trying to get hired, so I stopped
looking for a job, and apart from that, I found a startup in the knowledge
management field I stopped looking for a job, and when I heard from a friend
that a startup in the knowledge management field was being established, I
immediately joined.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Which kind of jobs did you
have before creating High Five? Perhaps you were involved with other online
games before Bright Kingdom (which I will now abbreviate as Burakin)?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>At a startup I joined after
graduating from college, the Java language became available on Japanese cell
phones (not smart phones, but feature phones with 10 keys), so I designed an
application that would communicate with a server and send a voice message from
a cell phone asking, &quot;Do you know any good restaurants in this
neighborhood? The application would then consult a database on the server and
send the name of the restaurant, contact information, and a map.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>By having databases in several
different genres, users can draw on the knowledge of numerous experts from a
single application interface.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The application that has become
common today with Siri and GPT was conceived in 2000.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>However, this was not a viable
business model that could pay for the processor power, database licenses, and
data center usage fees at the time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Later, after consulting with a
Korean groupware developer who was looking to expand into Japan, we began
working on localizing web solutions for Korean business users for the Japanese
market.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>This is how we got into the
business of publishing Korean MMORPGs in Japan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Before Bright Kingdom, we
published &quot;Seal Online&quot;, and GameMaster's history as
&quot;Sionic&quot; began with Seal.<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><br><b>We have seen many times the

behind this avatar? It is supposed to be a representation of you, right Mr.
Sionic?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Yes, I have been using the same
profile picture for 20 years. I have used the same profile picture for 20
years. My Wife drew it. 20 years ago it was Girl friend because it was before I
married her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I created the name
&quot;Sionic&quot; by changing my real name &quot;Shion&quot; as the GM name
for Seal Online and used that GM character. This is also a parody of Sega's
&quot;Sonic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Sionic&quot; is pronounced
&quot;Shi-o-ni-kku&quot; in Japanese, but players read it as
&quot;Shi-o-Ni-ku&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Shio&quot; is pronounced like
&quot;Salt,&quot; and &quot;Niku&quot; is pronounced like &quot;meat.
Niku&quot; is pronounced like &quot;Meat&quot;. Since Seal had both Salt and
Meat as items, players affectionately called me &quot;Shio-niku&quot; (salt
meat).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The picture I use for my profile
picture is a representation of me, or &quot;Shio-niku,&quot; when I am
controlling the GM character.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>What is it that you do
nowadays? Are you still part of the gaming industry, or have you moved on to a
different business sector?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I run a smartphone game
development and operation company called Amatz Inc. This is a small company
that plans, develops and operates novel games for women. However, I have now
trusted my co-owner to take care of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>So what am I doing? My main focus
right now is administration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I have a habit of diving into
unfamiliar fields when they interest me, and you may be surprised to learn that
I ran for and fought in the 2020 election for the position of Tokyo
Metropolitan governor of a prefecture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Although I lost the election, I
was invited to be a local goverment of Kanagawa prefecture (Kanagawa
prececture) in the south of Tokyo, and I am an advisor for the digital
administration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I am also a writer, publishing a
novel about a blockchain game in 2019, and I am working on a book a year while
working on other projects, and starting in 2021, I am writing a series of
novels set in Tokyo in the future for DIME magazine, a well-known publishing
house! Why do you write at the same time?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The reason for my dual role as a
writer is that successive governors of Tokyo have been either writers or TV
personalities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>In other words, for a long time,
the city of Tokyo and its residents have wanted &quot;a celebrity who can
convey a lot of knowledge in an easy-to-understand written form,&quot; not
someone who is strong in politics or military economics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I am also a writer because I need
to be well-prepared and ready to fight another gubernatorial election someday.<br

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><br><b>We would now like to ask about
High Five Entertainment, the company that you founded and directed. What were
your motives for its creation and expectations at the time?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>In December of 2005, after I left
my position as publisher of Seal Online, I was invited to join the next MMORPG
project. It was the Japanese version of Shine Online.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Shine Online was being prepared
to be released before High5 by the web services division of a publicly traded
company (whose name I will not reveal).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>However, the listed company
informed the team members that the project was cancelled because it may or may
not be profitable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Since we were in the process of
signing a Japanese publishing deal for Shine Online with OnsOn (then called
Aragon), I and the other members of the team were distressed and decided to
find a new investor to form a new company. So we found a venture capitalist,
who invested a lot of money, and High5 was created.<br clear=all
style='page-break-before:always'>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><br><b>Was Burakin the main reason
behind the creation of High Five, or did Burakin simply happen to be its first
most famous game?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Yes, I am aware of the fact that
High5 was created first and foremost for Burakin publishing. High5 was created
first and foremost to publish Burakin. But after that, the plan was to increase
the number of MMORPG publishing titles and to release titles developed
in-house.<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><br><b>Besides Burakin, were other
games distributed or developed by the company?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>In addition, there were casual
tennis games and &quot;AD quest (Korea's Forgotten Online),&quot; which adopted
an advertising model that was rare at the time. We also subcontracted the
management of &quot;Stragarden,&quot; a Japanese-made game.<br clear=all

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><br><b>How many staff members did

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>We know that OnsOn Soft, the
company that developed Shine Online, was korean. How was communication first
established with them?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Starting around 2000, a
phenomenon in the Japanese game industry at that time was that a number of
Korean companies wanted to enter the MMORPG field in Japan. Therefore,
experienced MMORPG operators were receiving invitations to publish in Japan and
materials on new games on a daily basis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>In order to strengthen our
business, High5's board of directors included members with strong connections
to Korean game companies, so business with OnsOn began as one of the many games
that were introduced to us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Regarding communication with
Korean companies,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>When I was originally managing
Seal Online, grigon, Seal's developer, was also a Korean company,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Before that, my job was to
localize Korean web services, so it was not difficult to get Japanese and
Korean speaking staff.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I personally took Korean lessons,
and as you can see in the article below, I was able to perform business
greetings with beautiful pronunciation. (I can hardly speak it now, though.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><a

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I mentioned earlier that there
are 4 planners and localizers, including a Korean who can speak Japanese.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Nowadays, communication across
the world is instantaneous and trivial thanks to smartphones and messaging
applications such as LINE, but this was not the case back then, not to mention
smartphones did not exist back then (LOL). How did you maintain contact with
OnsOn?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Yes, we don't have Zoom as we do
today, so MSN Messenger was mainly useful, and we would talk on Polycom, a
voice-only conference call system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>And I also traveled directly to
Seoul, Korea for Meetings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>To my regret, I had to use strong
words that I didn't want to say much that I had just learned to negotiate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>This is a nostalgic photo. This

wearing a suit when I went to Korea.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The frequency of business trips
was once every few months for me. I remember that I traveled on a rotating basis
with other executives. It was mostly for business talks, but I always took my
planner and localization staff with me to talk about development and art.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Under which conditions was
Burakin licensed to High Five? We would like to know details about how often
the license had to be renewed and what kind of revenue model was established
between High Five and OnsOn with respect to the license royalties.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Although we cannot disclose the
details of individual contracts, we will talk about a typical MMORPG made in
Korea at that time (2000~) that was developed for the Japanese market.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>A contract fee is paid to obtain
the exclusive rights to distribute the game in Japan. And since no sales are
generated during the preparation period of closed beta and open beta in Japan,
the development company has no choice but to work hard within the contract fee.
This amount was reported on news sites and other media in Korea, and for the
MMORPG genre, $1 million (100 million Japanese yen at the time) was common.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>When commercialization begins in
Japan, most contracts call for the developer to pay a percentage of the
remaining amount, after subtracting settlement fees for credit cards, etc.,
from monthly sales.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>In some cases, a portion of the
initial payment is treated as a minimum guarantee after commercialization, and
monthly remittances from Japan to Korea begin after a certain level of sales is
reached.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Contracts with OnsOn were also
generally common, although I will not go into detail.</p>

<span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Liberation Serif",serif'><br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Moving onto the game itself,
did High Five have full creative freedom over the design of Burakin, or was it
limited by strict guidelines dictated by OnsOn?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>They gave High5 free reign when
it came to the art to be developed in Japan. As for costumes and items, there
are no restrictions on creating their own for Japan, and OnsOn will use them
for the Korean version if they fit the user culture, and if there are requests
to use them in other countries, OnsOn will mediate and the publishers in other
countries will use them.<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><br><b>Did OnsOn allow you and the
developers of High Five to use their software tools to modify the files of the
game, or was every change strictly done by OnsOn?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>High5 had received template files
and Korean version files from OnsOn, and based on these files, we created data
for changes and sent them to OnsOn for implementation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The reason for this is that if
their software tools were used by Japanese staff to make changes to the code,
there would be problems with version control.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Only OnsOn would do version
control. That was the best choice.<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>What was your philosophy at
the time to make Burakin different from other MMO games at the time?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>We always tried to incorporate
things that other MMORPGs had never done before. This was because High5 was a
new company and we knew that we would not be able to compete immediately
against companies with strong capital.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>We wanted to be nimble and take
measures that larger companies could not use for reputational risk or
compliance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Liberation Serif",serif'><br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Not too long ago, we learned
that Burakin had voiced lines for the NPCs. This surprised us, since this
feature was not present in other versions of the game. Was it you who decided
to implement the voiced lines?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Yes, we did. We hired a
well-known Japanese company specializing in voice actors called Aoni
Productions. The reason for including Japanese voices was very simple: I
thought it was strange that voices were used in PlayStation and Xbox games, but
not in PC MMORPGs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>And since I am an otaku, I knew
that there was a boom in voice acting in the Japanese animation field, so I
thought we should hire professional voice actors. My personal favorite is the
voice of the village chief.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>When the Fiesta expansion was
released on Burakin, a new custom OST was developed for the game, but it was
never released or used by other versions of Fiesta. Was this due to copyright,
or simply a game design decision by OnsOn and the other publishers?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The reason we created our own
background music for Bright Kingdom in Japan is as a means of localization;
what surprised me about the Open beta service was that the field music, except
for Lumen, was selected at random. There should be coastal music for the beach
and forest music for the forest. And since game music is just as important as
screen Effects, whether it is to create a sense of adventure or fear, depending
on the scene, we created all new background music.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>No rights issues have arisen
regarding the OST (CD); it was made with legitimate permission from OnsOn. We
do not know why OSTs were not created for other versions of Fiesta. Maybe the
companies with distribution rights in other countries were not really
interested in the sound.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Since I was familiar with the
rights issues in the music industry, I divided the original CD into two discs
and named them &quot;Side-K&quot; and &quot;Side-J.&quot; K is for Korea and J
is for Japan. K is for Shine Online and contains music created in Korea. J
contains music created in Japan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>By splitting K and J into two
discs, we made sure that if there was a rights issue between Japan and Korea,
we could sell only one of the new discs based on the original in each country.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>But we didn't need to worry about
that. We were that friendly with each other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Related to the previous question,
it seems that the new music tracks were made by “NKS Project” but published by
“Super Sweep”. Could you confirm if this was the case?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Yes, the name NKS Project
contains the &quot;S&quot; of &quot;Sawa&quot; because it is one letter of the
last name of the producer involved. I think the &quot;N&quot; was Mr.
&quot;Nakagawa&quot;, the &quot;K&quot; I can't remember right now...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Super Sweep is a trusted agent

OnsOn?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>For High5, I changed the name to
&quot;Bright Kingdom&quot; because &quot;Shine&quot; in &quot;Shine
Online&quot; reads &quot;Shi-ne (You must die)&quot; when pronounced in
Japanese.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>There were several other name
candidates, but I chose this one, considering the culture of nicknames by
abbreviation in Japanese (cf. Dragon Quest -&gt; Dracula), where &quot;Bright
Kingdom&quot; is abbreviated as &quot;Burakin&quot;. I am glad that players
love the abbreviated name &quot;Burakin&quot; as I had envisioned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>As for the &quot;Fiesta&quot;
name, OnsOn made the decision, but since players loved &quot;Burakin&quot; in
Japan, we decided to market it as &quot;Bright Kingdom version Firsta&quot; to
make it look like one of the update seasons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>We decided to keep the main name
and put &quot;Fiesta&quot; as an identifying sign behind it, like &quot;Windows
XP&quot; and &quot;Windows Vista&quot; used at the time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Similarly to the music, there
were some costumes and hairstyles for the player characters (photo attached

related to any external brand, was there a reason for these game assets to
remain exclusive to Japan even after Burakin closed?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Costumes and hairstyles created
in Japan had their data consolidated in OnsOn so that if publishers in other countries
wanted to use them, they could. If they were not used in other countries, it
means that those publishers did not like them very much.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I only contacted OnsOn. I knew
that it would be difficult to learn know-how from Outspark's operational

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Fighter. I like two-handed axes
and use them when playing many RPGs. However, I think that costumes look better
on Archer women. This is because when designing costumes in Japan, designers
often drew cute things that would look good on Archer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>My favorite map is the King Boyon
(King Slime) map from Kingdom Quest. It is played with many players and the
atmosphere is most enjoyable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>As for music tracks, I like all
the ones created in Japan (included in Side-J), but I like the title back up
music for Fiesta (Fiesta Opening Part I). The reason for using a rondo as the
title is because it gives the impression of a world that includes a tragic
history that repeats itself forever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Certainly, we did not have modern

was not very sophisticated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>We were able to get statistics on

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Instead, our primary focus was on
the feedback we received via email and sending GameMasters into the game to see
how players were actually playing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>In USA, Fiesta had multiple
servers to prevent a massive influx of players from saturating a single world.
If my memory serves right, there were 5 available servers to choose from during

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I don't remember much about this
either, I think it was 4 sets, 1-1, 1-2, 2-1, 2-2. Four sets, but we were
running about 100 server hardware units in a data center.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I remember in 2008 or 2009, High5
had to reduce the number of servers in the data center due to financial

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Not only did I have to operate
the database, but I actually went to the data center and &quot;moved&quot; the
blade servers by loading them onto a dolly with several people and hauling them
out. It's amazing to think that now we can manage instances inexpensively in
the cloud all without such a ridiculous number of units, and the technological

modifications did you make to Burakin in order to accommodate it for japanese
players? I’m asking from the perspective of game balance, such as monster and
quest experience, game difficulty, player movement, etc.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>This is an area where we
disagreed with OnsOn and made many adjustments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>MMORPGs are generally more
efficient with party play, but Burakin in Japan had many solo players.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>There was a big reason for this
in the game design. I wish there had been many advantages from party play, but
I remember there were few advantages and it was not very good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The game balance was
unexhilarating: &quot;Soloing is difficult and party play is not tasty.&quot; I
also had a hard time wrapping my head around PvP, which was introduced midway
through the game; PvP is something you have to design a versus game from the
start, and implementing PvP as an update when you have a group of users who
value Chat communication and solo play is not something they will appreciate.
In the end, PvP did not take root in Japanese Burakin and was only enjoyed when
GameMaster ran exhibition events to make players feel like a sport.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I remember many clashes between
the OnsOn planners, who wanted the game to be played according to the game
design, and the High5 planners, who wanted the design to be optimized based on
how the players actually played.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>One of the most common requests
was to make Kingdom Quest more appealing, since it could be played casually,
even as a Raid battle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>How did you balance the
Free-to-play (F2P) aspect of the game? For reference, the publisher of Fiesta
in USA was relentless about the Pay-to-win (P2W) aspect, giving those players a
huge advantage. In fact, weapon and armor enchanting was essentially locked
behind a paywall, because even for low levels, enchanting required the use of
Cash Shop items, thus leaving F2P players behind.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>When Bright Kingdom went
commercial, there was a conflict among members.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Regarding the weapon items for
sale, there was a split between members who wanted to set the price high
because selling strong items with a limited number of days of use would upset
the game balance, and members who wanted to set the price low so that the items
could be worn out over and over again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>There were still many games that
charged a monthly fee, and this was a time when the term &quot;game balance&quot;
was used to &quot;keep the game as level as possible and keep the updates from
depleting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>We ended up with a lower price,
which was fine until we got to version Fiesta.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>However, with version Fiesta, the
&quot;it's too hard to solo and party play is not good&quot; situation I
mentioned earlier became stronger, and items for sale for enchanting became
less and less useful, and only playing for a long time became effective.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I think the situation has become
uninteresting for both F2P users and paid-purchase users.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Costumes were popular in Japan,
so it was important for artists to come up with new designs each month.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>We wondered how much of a
numerical advantage we should give to costumes, but we did not want to make it
too exciting. What happens when you give a large advantage is that previous
buyers get angry at the cost of repurchasing, and new buyers are discouraged
from communicating.<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><br><b>Moving onto the social aspects
of Burakin, what was your philosophy for marketing the game? Given that it was

used?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>This was not a problem in the PC

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The real problem, however, was
the lack of a complete set of tools to capture marketing data, as is the case
with modern smartphone apps.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>For example, I would first
attempt to eliminate the &quot;abandonment rate&quot; of any service, but
without knowing how many lvls a player has played after installing and whether
they continue to log in after that, it is impossible to improve.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Also, at that time, the only
effective means of advertising was &quot;banner ads&quot; on information

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The FANG manga is rather aimed at
attracting new players. Therefore, the manga uses only the stage setting, and
the story is unrelated to the main scenario of Bright Kingdom, and is only
&quot;such an adventurer might have existed&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The manga magazine &quot;Monthly
Shonen Fang&quot; was a challenge for Lido, a company whose publisher in the
first place publishes many hard-core adult-oriented manga stories, to enter the
market of manga magazines for boys. The manga magazine was to publish manga in
a variety of genres, and manga on themes that boys would like, such as baseballs
and monsters, were picked up, and one of those themes was the demand for a
&quot;game comic book&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>This is where the idea of Bright
Kingdom, which needed to develop new customers, fit in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>THE NETGAMES was a series of
magazines, one for each MMORPG title, which was rare in Japan at the time. This
was created to both attract new customers as well as to entertain existing
players. However, the artwork of the items that Burakin offered as special
offers was not very appealing. This was due to the short production period of
the magazine, which did not allow time to implement attractive items in Bright
Kingdom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>In Japan at that time, there were
many users with slow connection speeds, so it made sense to create and sell an
installation CD in this way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>However, since the installer was originally
a free download, it was designed so that purchasers would not feel that they
had lost money on the sales price.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The idea was to make the set
worth the price by adding items that can be used in the game and fan goods such

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>PLANEX invested in High5 as well,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>As part of such efforts, we

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Yes, we did. We did not think

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>The design of the Burakin
website is amazing, however there are only low resolution screenshots of it
left. Was it a single person who did both the graphic design and the
programming for it, or was it multiple people? In either case, who was the
person or people who developed the website?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>All websites are created by High5
members. My policy is that &quot;web design is engineering,&quot; so the web
designers belonged to the same team as the engineers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>On the other hand, the artists
who draw the characters belonged to the same team as the planners.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The source code of the site was
lost along with the servers after the company changed to NETBANCO, so it is
difficult to reproduce. (I'll try to find an old hard drive to see if there are
any screenshots from back then, same answer as before...)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Not counting concept art, for
the design of the Burakin posters and advertisements, did you hire a single
artist or were there multiple artists in charge of this?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>In the early stages of the
Japanese rollout, we had no choice but to use art from Shine Online because of
the short production period. Later, we had several artists participate and
obtained a variety of ad designs, but there was no sense of unity, so in the
latter stages, two in-house artists began to create the ads.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>There are images of a card
system similar to Yu-Gi-Oh! made for the game, but we have no idea about the
context behind these (photo attached below). Was it just a fan art by some
player, or was this a real feature designed by High Five?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>This is a simple collection of
cards that can be enjoyed only on the Web site and was created in High5.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Generally, game players want to
play the game, not read the website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>However, we, as the operator, had
a shopping mall on the website that sold items, so we had to provide users with
a fun experience on the website and direct them to the website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>So we came up with several
strategies and decided to implement a simple collection feature that would
allow users to collect as many card drawings as possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Each card picture is accompanied
by a text explaining the Burakin world setting to help players understand the
Burakin world.</p>

is the so called “The Triple Play”, which seems to have been hosted around the

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Today, YouTubers are doing the

was distributing games on Windows Media Server in 2006.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I started the &quot;In-game
fixed-point camera&quot; to show people who have not yet played the game that
the fun of MMORPGs lies in the point where many people gather. For those who
are already playing, if they see a lot of players on the screen, they will want
to log in themselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The &quot;live-streaming&quot;
was done to show that Burakin is emotionally stimulating and fun by showing
people how I myself enjoy playing it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Today, everyone is doing this,
but at the time, it was something I came up with to fulfill one point: &quot;I

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>This is a web video introduction
movie of Bright Kingdom, featuring the famous Japanese comedian &quot;Yasuda
the Great Circus&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Yasuda's circus performs a trick
in which the central figure (Yasuda's leader) has his clothes torn off and is
dressed in a &quot;naked tie&quot; to elicit laughter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>In this movie, when Commander
Yasuda visits High5, I greet him dressed in a naked tie, a surreal gag.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>We then introduce the game while
playing Burakin together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>No license is required for the

know about is </b><b><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Noto Sans CJK SC",serif'>コミケット</span></b><b>numbers
70 and 72. It seems that you hosted a booth here and distributed the Bright

lang=JA style='font-family:"Noto Sans CJK SC",serif'>コミケット</span></b><b>and the
interactions you had with the Burakin players?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Comiket is Japan's largest
festival for people who enjoy manga, anime, and games. We decided to
participate in Comiket with the idea that we could use this opportunity to
raise the profile of Burakin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I had been participating in
Comiket since my days at Seal, so I was familiar with it, and High5's in-house
artists also had a deep understanding of Comiket as individual illustrators,
which made it possible. I also drew a simple cartoon in the fan book.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Are you aware of any radio or
TV programs that featured your company High Five or Burakin?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The radio program is linked to
the manga miscellany &quot;Monthly Shonen Fang&quot; mentioned earlier. It is
on the Japanese radio station Bunka Hoso, which is a station that broadcasts a
number of programs that are strong in animation, video games and voice-over
culture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The program was called
&quot;Weekly Shonen Fang&quot;, the manga magazine was Monthly and the radio
program was Weekly. The radio program was renewed after several broadcasts, and
I was invited to be a part of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Famous voice actors Katsuyuki
Konishi and Wataru Hatano hosted the show, and my role was to provide
commentary on the Internet and PC culture according to the topic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Since the program was in
conjunction with a manga magazine, the radio program ended at the same time the
manga magazine ended publication.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(The publisher's attempts to
reach boys did not work out.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I don't remember the TV program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>When the contract was completed
for Burakin at High5, we had a party to celebrate the company's founding. This
was an attempt to advertise Burakin by inviting the press, and it was aired for
a few minutes on a local TV station in Tokyo as part of the business news. It
was very cost-effective.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Do you still keep in touch
with staff from High Five and OnsOn?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>We don't actively keep in touch,
but now that we have social networking sites, we can kind of know what's going
on. I am moving on with my new life at my new employer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>In retrospect, how do you see
Burakin and its impact on early online gaming in Japan?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I think we have been innovative
in our operational and marketing methods. There were many other gaming
companies that saw what Burakin was marketing and imitated them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>As for the game itself, I think
Bright Kingdom is a very approachable game when considered as an MMORPG, and is
ideal for the desire to play while communicating primarily.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>However, it is only a Japanese
localization of Shine Online, and we decided that it would be difficult to
differentiate the game as a game only within the scope of localization.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>OnsOn's work is very commendable,
but a developer creates a game that is the ideal of the developer and not the
ideal of the publisher. This is the same problem with any localized game.<br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b><br>With all the experience that
you have accumulated now, would you have done something different with the
marketing and game balancing of Burakin?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The information we get from
customer support is important but limited, so I would implement marketing tools
to get evidence and improve the in-game content that players want.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>In terms of marketing, the
in-game advertising system that we worked on with Burakin in Japan is now
common in smartphone apps today, so I think we will promote it to improve the
F2P user experience. I think we would change the game balance to make solo play
more fun and party play more enjoyable.</p>

director of a gaming company, what advice would you give to new people in the
gaming industry to help them develop successful MMO games?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>...I have written many things,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>As we approach the end of this

lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Noto Sans CJK SC",serif'>キングダム</span> (</b><b><span
lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Noto Sans CJK SC",serif'>キャンペーンソング</span>)” is

online, </b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlYcc9WB0tM"><b>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlYcc9WB0tM</b></a><b>.
If possible, we would like to hear the story behind the creation and recording
of this song. Also, do you have a higher quality version of this video?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>This music video was shot during
the time of producing the OST.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>First of all, Mi-Wa-Ku★Kingdom
was a secret track created by N and K out of NKS Project.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I was not informed and was
suddenly asked to put lyrics on the track because I had written a fun song.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I can also write lyrics, so I
wrote it up right away, but I didn't expect to sing it myself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>In the end, during the studio
recording of the OST, they used the extra time to record me singing the song.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Then, a friend of mine who works
as a broadcaster heard it and liked the song so much that he decided to make a
music video using him and his staff, and we bought HipHop costumes of the time
in &quot;Harajuku,&quot; a town for young people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>A high quality version of this
video file does not exist. Because in 2006-7, the Japanese Internet was calling
even VGA (640x480) size &quot;high quality&quot;, and we did not resourcefully
edit the video with a Pixel Size larger than that!</p>
